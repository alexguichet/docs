What storage drives/services I have available, their descriptions, and an exhaustive list of content stored when needed.

As of August 2017, I have simplified my external HDD storage into 1x 4TB & 1x 2TB. This replaced my prior 1x 2TB & 3x 1TB setup which had considerable data fragmentation. I am also simplifying my file system by moving away from NTFS (removing an application dependency) and switching fully to HFS+. In the rare case _both_ macOS and Windows r/w compatibility is needed, I will create an exFAT partition.

## Future Devices

Am considering unifying my two external drives by purchasing a single 3.5" 12TB Western Digital Gold drive, but would need to create a case for it, and would ideally like a Thunderbolt 3 cable that can supply power + data.

No plans to purchase more USB drives until USB-C situation is viable across my workflow.
