## Workflow

This portion of the document describes my processes and workflows for the movement of photos around my devices and onto social media.

### Camera settings

For iOS camera settings, see [iOS Settings](ios-settings.html).

Sony camera settings as shown below:

* Compressed RAW (no JPEG)

### Transferral of photos from capturing device

Principles:

* All photos should be synced into iCloud Photo Library in original highest resolution, in RAW if possible.

  For photos taken on iPhone or iPad, this process is automatic; as iCloud syncing enabled.

  For photos taken on my Sony ⍺7rii, they must be imported over an SD card, or via wired USB connection. The former involves ejectng the SD card from the camera, and inserting it into my MacBook Pro. The latter involves connecting the camera over microUSB + USB to either my desktop or laptop while in USB mass storage mode. In both cases, Photos.app will open, and the most recent photos not already in Photos will be imported.

Problems:

1. Sony Play Memories app on iOS theoretically allows for the importing of photos directly onto iPhone over WiFi, but the imported photo quality is too low to be of use.

2. Have not yet had time to figure out how to import photos from camera to computer over WiFi.

3. Do not have a SD card adapter, will need one for desktop + next laptop.

### DAM Organization (Photos.app)

Principles:

* Photos should be organized into albums where possible in Photos.app. A photo can and may belong to more than one album. Albums are themselves grouped into folders based on their types.

* Folders for albums include: _World_ (Travel, vacations, walks, photos of landscapes, etc), _Hobbies_ (SpaceX, Skateboards, etc), _Events_ (Meetups, photos with other people), _Devices_ (Things I've owned), _Pets_ (Pets in my life), & _Work_ (ordered by employer).

  Albums & Subfolders inside of _World_ should have a name belonging to the form `Name // Area // Mon Year`. Albums & Subfolders inside of _Events_ should have a name belonging to the form `Event // Mon Year`.

* Once photos are organized into folders and albums, they are synced across all devices automatically.

* Images posted, or queued to be posted on social sites are stored in an album in iCloud titled _Social_, under the _Apps_ folder (as it includes Instagram & VSCO too).

Problems:

1. Photos.app has some annoying irremovable smart albums that I must live with (this has been improved with macOS High Sierra).

## Mobile editing

Principles:

* Import the photo you wish to edit into VSCO by using the actions sharing extension from the Photos app. If this photo is a JPEG, this is a simple one step process. However, if the photo is RAW, this gets significantly more complicated. Due to bugs 2, 3, & 4 (possibly related to article [_The Quest for a Viable iOS RAW Workflow_](https://photoapps.expert/tips/2015/12/22/quest-viable-ios-raw-workflow)), RAW export/import editing is very convoluted on iPhone.

* This is solved by making a temporary JPEG duplicate of the RAW photo on desktop, which is then imported into VSCO, then deleted.

* Once the photo is edited, export the photo from VSCO into the _Social_ album in iCloud.

Problems:

1. Photos app on iPhone does not have enough editing tools to make editor useful to use.

2. VSCO photo editor has problems handling RAW files, with the appearance of photos suffering significantly, even on opening of photos (reported to developers).

3. Duplication & MarkUp functionality in the Photos app duplicate a RAW image, while MarkUp saves a very low resolution JPEG, respectively. This makes both useless for preparation of a copy to be imported into VSCO (issue 2 dependency).

4. Workflow.app is unable to duplicate, save, or share any RAW image file (issue 2 dependency), so cannot be used.

## Desktop Editing

Problems:

1. Lightroom & Pixelmator Pro not yet integrated into workflow yet.

## Posting to VSCO & Instagram

Principles:

* Post a maximum of 1 image per day onto Instagram & VSCO.

* Never do Follow for Follow's. Let followers accrue organically.

* Match the descriptions of VSCO & Instagram posts as closely as possible.

* Upload the same images to both Instagram & VSCO, in the same order. Make minor changes to the resolution & filesize in the case of Instagram, where images should be downscaled as follows:

* Images posted, or queued to be posted on social sites are stored in an album in iCloud titled _Social_, under the _Apps_ folder; in both raw & downsized edited forms.

* Keep all edited images stored in VSCO's studio.

Problems:

1. Photo descriptions may have a maximum of 30 hashtags on Instagram, or 150 characters on VSCO.

2. Instagram does not support 3:2 portrait photos; be aware that the cropping of the photo to fit Instagram's requirements may change the final composition of the image.

3. Instagram heavily compresses and downsizes large photos.

## Notes about Instagram Compression

Since June 2015, Instagram native image resolutions are:

* 1080px by 1080px square.

* 1080px by 1350px tall.

* 1080px by 566px wide.

## Camera to Instagram Walkthrough Exemplar

If image is RAW:

1. Export photo from Photos.app as an 100% quality, full size JPEG.
