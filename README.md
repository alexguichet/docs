A repository containing centralized information surrounding aspects of my development and personal life that I felt needed organizing; as well as personal best practices and standards that I can refer to for future reference. Anything that can be organized should be organized.

This repository will never be complete, it is merely an always-ongoing collection of summarized thoughts and notes.

It can be read online at [docs.lukeify.com](https://docs.lukeify.com).
